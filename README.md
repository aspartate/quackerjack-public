## Inspiration
Rubber duck debugging is a centuries-old technique trusted by programmers all over the world. However, traditionally programmers have had to supply both sides of the conversation when talking to their duck. This wastes valuable developer time, which is bad for maximizing shareholder value.

## What it does
QuackerJack is a fully autonomous rubber duck capable of not only listening but also responding to all your troubles, coding-related or otherwise. We offer 2 modes: Get Roasted and Get Therapy, as studies have shown that some people respond better to positive reinforcement and others to negative reinforcement. In Get Roasted mode, you will be thoroughly and diligently roasted, causing you to evaluate your life choices and hopefully try harder next time. In Get Therapy mode, you will be lifted back up to an appropriate level of self-esteem so you can continue making mistakes. Finally, we pave the way for a sustainable business model by offering the occasional mid-conversation ad, in which QuackerJack will try to convince you to buy Tesla stock.
